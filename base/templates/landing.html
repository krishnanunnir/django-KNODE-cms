        <p>Malayalam content has largely been restricted to websites like Facebook, Youtube and TikTok. These platforms have
            their own issues and I am trying to solve few of them with http://ezhuth.in.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Facebook has a lot of Malayalam discussions and literature but they are lost past a few days, and it is very
            difficult to rediscover this content. Basically we are losing out on quality content once Facebook has decided
            it is not viable to show a post algorithmically.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Niche content has largely been reduced to Youtube, there are some creators like @SharqSamsu who provide highly
            specialised info, but there is no platform like @reddit which provides better discourse on these topics.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This might sound generic but we often hear about stories of kids chancing on content on the internet and
            developing a passion for a subject, what are the chances this can happen if you are not English speaking?
            We can learn from China on this, even though it is a population that is largely shielded from the rest of the
            world, their adoption of native langauge on the internet have allowed for proliferation of all kinds content to
            everyone.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Localisation is the future. Being able to use our own language has allowed a lot of people to explode on the
            scene and make a living - ask tiktokers.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I think we need a new stage in this internet development and that will be localisation according to me.</p>
