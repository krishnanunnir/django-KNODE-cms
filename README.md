# <del>Crowdsourcing knowledge</del> CMS

I think in the process of developing this app, I changed my view of what to build. I feel like as important as crowd sourcing knowledge is, as challenging as it might be. I don't think it is the level of challenging I want or expect from what I am building. I am thinking about making it a CMS. As hard as it may sound, I think there is a possibility it can be done. This is why I am insisting on making the code as modular as possible, it is a highly experimental project so things might break a lot, so it is best we know which part works and which part doesn't, and even if things doesn't work the way we want it to. We can mix and match.

The modularity would also allows us to use things we build in this project in other projects.
